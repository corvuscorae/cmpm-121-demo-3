    - cache should be at 10% of the grid cells that are within 8 cell-steps away from the player’s current location
- [ ] deterministically generated coins offered at each location
- [ ] player location represented with a tooltip/popup
- [x] nearby cache locations represented with popups
- [x] add buttons to cache location popups...
